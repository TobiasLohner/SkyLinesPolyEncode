= skylinespolyencode : Python C++ extension module for multidimensional SkyLines polyline encoding =

Normally this is built as a Python extension:

  $ python setup.py install

But you can also use it from a C++ application directly:

  $ make
  $ ./skylinespolyencode_test

See skylinespolyencode_test.cpp for more details on how to interface with it.
